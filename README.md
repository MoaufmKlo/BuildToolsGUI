# BuildToolsGUI

BuildToolsGUI is a (currently) only Windows application which wraps Spigot BuildTools into an Electron GUI application.

It has an easy-to-understand interface, which anyone can understand easily and it requires no use of the console at all. Plus, it updates you to the latest version of BuildTools automatically.

## Installation and Usage

1. Download the tool (may take a while depending on GitHub), by going to the [releases](https://github.com/MoaufmKlo/BuildToolsGUI/releases) page and downloading the latest stable version.
2. Skip the Windows Warning; I do not have a $400 purchased signature, therefore I cannot make the warning go away. If you're worried about viruses, here's a virus check, or review the source code and build it yourself: [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0475550837045cf8353d183d08709926ee1ca1f8f1a00644fcbb47c44b44c136/detection)
3. Select a version and the folder in which BuildTools should be downloaded to and run in.
4. Click on "Build" and wait until it is completed.
